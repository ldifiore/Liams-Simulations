This is a project I've been working on  that simulates the interaction of particles in this version of the program it's simulates gravity between massive particles however it can be easily reconfigured to work with  lots of different forces ( there are actually already functions in the  particle.js  file that can be easily swapped ) this program uses the canvas API to animate the movement of particles.

The program uses:

  Custom draw functions

  2D vectors

  event listeners

  Functions

  Classes

To use the canvas API you must first create a canvas element within the HTML then access it in JavaScript  where you can manipulate  what is drawn and how  behaves.
